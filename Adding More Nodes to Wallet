A simple guide to adding new nodes quickly to the InfiniLooP wallet.
====================================================================
Ordinarily, your wallet connects to seed nodes, which provide it with additional IP connections
Such node aggregation within your wallet can take some time and requires continuous internet connection
If you want to quickly increase the number of nodes in your wallet, do the following:

1) Go to our block explorer:

   http://explorer.infiniloop.io

   OR 

   http://207.180.216.126:3007

2) On the TOP MENU, find "Network" and click on it

3) Now in your wallet, go to Debug Window / Console

4) Take each of the IPs displayed under "Network" and type the following (for each):

   addnode ABC.ABC.ABC.ABC add     <PRESS ENTER>
   [Note: Each "ABC" shuold be substituted by the IP number, so a sample address would be 62.171.189.175 and so on...]

5) The wallet will return "null" or nothing if the new address is truly new; The wallet will return an error if the address already in your wallet
