INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPILING THE InfiniLooP Daemon on Ubuntu 20.04:

Brief description / Statement of need: Multiple users noted difficulty compiling the daemon code on Ubuntu 20.04
This prompted us to develop a quick guide on how to compile InfiniLooP 1.2.5.5 on Ubuntu 20.04 and similar OS platforms
Note: There is NO GUARANTEE that this will work 100% of the time, and the user must be experienced enought for "compiling" in general
==================================================================
GUIDE STARTS HERE:

1) Make InfiniLooP folder in /home directory

2) Download InfiniLooP 1.2.5.5 source from GitHub

3) Download and deploy eCoinCore depends into your InfiniLooP folder
[here] https://github.com/Canada-eCoin/eCoinCore/tree/master/depends
[best download full eCoinCore ZIP here] https://github.com/Canada-eCoin/eCoinCore/archive/master.zip
[then extract depends]

4) Note your directory structure where everything is – This will be important a few steps from now
[if you are unsure, you can open file explorer in Ubuntu and right-click then “properties” to get a path for a particular file or folder]

5) Do some reading from the eCoinCore depends repo: https://github.com/Canada-eCoin/eCoinCore/blob/master/depends/README.md

6) Then go do the depends folder that you decompressed into your InfiniLooP folder
[If you are in terminal already, you are set; If you are in explorer, then right-click + “open in terminal”]

7) In the newly opened terminal you should be in a folder ~/InfiniLooP/depends

8) type “make” <ENTER>
--== NOW WAIT TILL EVERYTHING COMPILES ==--== WILL BE A WHILE ==--

9) Ok – Now that it’s all compiled, time to go to work compiling… first the daemon (infiniloopd):
	[a] Go to /InfiniLooP/src
	[b] Open “makefile.unix” using “sudo gedit makefile.unix”
	[c] scroll down to text “DEFS=-DBOOST_SPIRIT_THREADSAFE”
	[d] Right below that line, insert the following lines (note – exact path should be as outliend above in #4):

	  BOOST_INCLUDE_PATH=/[see #4 above for path]/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/include 
	  BOOST_LIB_PATH=/[see #4 above for path]/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/lib 
	  BDB_INCLUDE_PATH=/[see #4 above for path]/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/include 
	  BDB_LIB_PATH=/[see #4 above for path]/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/lib 
	  OPENSSL_INCLUDE_PATH=/[see #4 above for path]/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/include 
	  OPENSSL_LIB_PATH=/[see #4 above for path]/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/lib

10) Now save the document, but do not close it… there are more modifications required:
	[a] Scroll down till you see the following, starting with “LIBS += \ ” and change it so it looks 	EXACTLY as shown below (basically replace “$(BOOT_LIB_SUFFIX)” with “-mt” as 	shown):

	LIBS += \ 
	  -Wl,-B$(LMODE) \ 
		-l boost_system-mt \ 
		-l boost_filesystem-mt \ 
		-l boost_program_options-mt \ 
		-l boost_thread-mt \ 
		-l db_cxx$(BDB_LIB_SUFFIX) \ 
		-l ssl \ 
		-l crypto

11) So far, so good… now let’s make the daemon

	Type: “make -f makefile.unix”
	And wait till all is done…
	And voila… you should have the following new file in your /src directory:
		“infiniloopd”
	That’s the daemon… 

SPECIAL NOTE: If any errors related to "leveldb" / PIE appear during the compilation process, please try this procedure: 
[1] Go to your 'src/leveldb' directory; 
[2] open terminal (if not in terminal already) and type "make clean" <ENTER>; 
[3] go back to your 'src' folder and repeat "make -f makefile.unix"
